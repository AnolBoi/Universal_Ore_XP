A simple mod which allows data pack and mod pack creators to add xp drops to modded or vanilla blocks/ores easily with just editing/creating a JSON file! 
The mod by itself automatically makes Gold and Deepslate Gold Ore, Iron and Deepslate Iron Ore, Copper and Deepslate Copper Ore and Ancient Debris drop exp. 
So if you want to use the mod by itself, that is completely okay!
